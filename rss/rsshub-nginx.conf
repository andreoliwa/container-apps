# Nginx proxy configuration for RSSHub
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# ---------------------
# TT-RSS has a bug/limitation where it strips non-standard ports from feed URLs when saving them.
# For example, if you add a feed like "http://rsshub-internal:1200/twitter/user/elonmusk", TT-RSS will
# silently convert it to "http://rsshub-internal/twitter/user/elonmusk" (removing the :1200 port).
# This causes feed updates to fail because the connection goes to port 80 instead of 1200.
#
# SOLUTION:
# ---------
# This nginx proxy (named "rsshub") listens on port 80 and forwards all requests to rsshub-internal:1200.
# This way, TT-RSS can use "http://rsshub/..." URLs without any port number,
# and nginx will transparently proxy the requests to the actual RSSHub service on port 1200.
#
# WHY NOT CONSOLIDATE WITH WEB-NGINX?
# ------------------------------------
# The web-nginx container serves the TT-RSS web UI to your browser.
# The TT-RSS app container is what actually fetches RSS feeds.
# The app container needs to make HTTP requests to rsshub, which is a separate network path.
# We can't use web-nginx as a proxy for the app container's outbound requests.
#
# USAGE IN TT-RSS:
# ----------------
# Use: http://rsshub/twitter/user/elonmusk
# (This service proxies to http://rsshub-internal:1200/twitter/user/elonmusk)
